Welcome!

This repo contains demo projects for people who wish to experiment and learn about improving performance in apps.

The recommended order is:
1. ScrollingSmooth
2. ImagesInTables



When you attempt to fix these apps, try not to change their behavior. Also make sure you are able to explain why the changes you make are necessary. It's good practice to know exactly what is slow and why and not simply to change random things until it gets better.
